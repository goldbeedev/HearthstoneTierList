				<p class="tier-about-p">Tier 1 includes the decks that are dominating the current meta.  Losing against these decks often feels very one-sided or unfair, unless of course you are playing a tier 1 deck yourself.  This causes the meta to form around a select few decks, of which you either play them or play to beat them to rank up the ladder.  You should seriously consider playing a tier 1 deck if you want to rank up the ladder.  Currently, two classes are dominating this section: Hunter and Druid.</p>
