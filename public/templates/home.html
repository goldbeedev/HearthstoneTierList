								<p class="about-text"> Welcome to Hearthstone Tier List!  This website is about strictly one thing: The current "Standard" meta that exists on the Hearthstone ranked ladder.  I noticed a lot of the meta websites around the interweb are not updated regularly, thus the meta has usually shifted by the time the updates were released.  In addition, majority of the Hearthstone meta websites include other pointless fluff.  This website will be updated every Sunday with the current decks that are shaping the meta-game in Hearthstone.</p>
								<p class="about-text"> How to use this website - Click a tier in the meta section below to see where the current decks running the meta rank.  The tiers are as follows:
									<ul class="tier-text">
										<li>Tier 1 - Decks that are currently dominating the meta, these decks have very few weaknesses and are often referred to as "op".</li>
										<li>Tier 2 - Decks that have a strong foothold on the meta, and are typically refined to target tier 1 decks.  These decks also contain few weaknesses but are more exploitable than tier 1.</li>
										<li>Tier 3 - Decks that are still competitive, however, have more weaknesses than tier 1 and 2 and often struggle vs these decks.</li>
										<li>Tier 4 - Decks that can be played on ladder, and still take wins off the first 3 tiers but are not optimal if you would like to be climbing the ladder.</li>
									</ul>

								Well Witchwood has been upon us for over two weeks now, and the meta is starting to settle.  As we all expected, Cubelock still reigns as the supreme ladder deck, having very few terrible matchups, and even those are still winnable.  Another reason for Cubelock's dominance is its ability to shut out the various aggressive Paladin lists flooding the ladder.  It will be interesting to see the meta morph as more and more lists become refined.  This website aims to be updated every Sunday, to bring relevant meta information, with the next update on 5-5-18.  This website is for fun, and educational purposes only, and additional features will be added as we go.

								4-26-18: All of the tiers have been updated, and the respective decks in place.  Currently the site is working off of 4 tiers with 4 decks per tier.  Tier 3 and 4 can still be compeitive decks, but aren't finding as much success as the Tier 1 and 2.  If you want to do some serious climbing on the ladder it's best to stick with decks like the ones listed in the first two tiers.
