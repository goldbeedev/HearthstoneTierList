								<p class="about-text"> Welcome to Hearthstone Tier List!  This website is about strictly one thing: The current "Standard" meta that exists on the Hearthstone ranked ladder.  I noticed a lot of the meta websites around the interweb are not updated regularly, thus the meta has usually shifted by the time the updates were released.  In addition, majority of the Hearthstone meta websites include other pointless fluff.  This website will be updated every Sunday with the current decks that are shaping the meta-game in Hearthstone.  This website is for fun, and educational purposes only, and additional features will be added as we go.</p>
								<p class="about-text"> How to use this website - Click a tier in the meta section below to see where the current decks running the meta rank.  The tiers are as follows:
									<ul class="tier-text">
										<li>Tier 1 - Decks that are currently dominating the meta, these decks have very few weaknesses and are often referred to as "op".</li>
										<li>Tier 2 - Decks that have a strong foothold on the meta, and are typically refined to target tier 1 decks.  These decks also contain few weaknesses but are more exploitable than tier 1.</li>
										<li>Tier 3 - Decks that are still competitive, however, have more weaknesses than tier 1 and 2 and often struggle vs these decks.</li>
										<li>Tier 4 - Decks that can be played on ladder, and still take wins off the first 3 tiers but are not optimal if you would like to be climbing the ladder.</li>
									</ul>

								Well the post Witchwood nerf has hit, and it has definitely shaken up the meta.  The nerf of Dark Pact only healing for 4 and Possessed Lackey costing 6 has caused a major down turn in the number of Cubelock decks running around the ladder.  The deck still seems strong with several players in high legend running it, but it is too early to tell if it will continue seeing a decline in play/strength.  Spiteful summoner being nerfed to 7 doesn't seem as bad, but we don't see as many Spiteful Druids in play either, another deck to watch as the meta shapes.  Even Paladin appears to be completely dead, as Call to Arms nerfed to 5 mana makes it unplayable in the deck (and it was the strongest card).  One notable mention is that Taunt Druid appears to be back with reckless abandon, as the decline of Cubelock and increase of Spell hunter have warranted this.  Many lists in high legend are floating around.  Another Druid deck that becomes a very strong player in the meta game is Token Druid, versions of this deck have been around since the inception of the game, but with the addition of Wispering Woods creates another easy method for a strong board state for the deck.  These changes have caused the previously known fringe deck 'Miracle Rogue' to gain momentum again, also with several high legend decklists being played.  It will be interesting to see if Druid keeps a foothold at the top of the meta, along with Spell hunter which according to metastats currently has a 60% win rate across the board.

								5-31-18: All of the tiers have been updated, and the respective decks in place.  Currently the site is working off of 4 tiers with 4 decks per tier.  Tier 3 and 4 can still be compeitive decks, but aren't finding as much success as the Tier 1 and 2.  If you want to do some serious climbing on the ladder it's best to stick with decks like the ones listed in the first two tiers.
